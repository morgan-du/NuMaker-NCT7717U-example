# NCT7717U on NuMaker IoT boards example

NCT7717U is a high precision and low-power consumption thermal sensor IC.
It supports I2C (SMBus) interface.

This example create a class to control NCT7717U via I2C interface.
NuMaker-IoT-M467 has the sensor on board. For other boards, please specify the I2C pins in main.cpp.
